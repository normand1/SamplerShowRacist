|**I saw a white woman with box braids**... ...But I gave her a good old hard look and I was like "No... you're an actual **white woman**, you actually have box braids". So **my body tensed up and I got stressed** and like I said before I talk a good game, but I'm not a **fighting woman** you know what I'm saying. I don't have the physical ability. But I did give her the look... **"Do you have a fucking problem?"** I gave her the look of "Do you have a"... **I made eye contact with her** and I was with another black woman. We confirmed after the fact that we had both given her the **"Do you have a fucking problem"** look. I'm gonna tell you something right now. **Speaking directly to white women** who feel the need to get some Bo Derek raggedy ass corn rows... Or Locks... Or Box braids, or **whatever the fuck**. **First of all don't**. Second of all **they don't look cute on you** so don't be getting any ideas. THEY-DON'T-LOOK-CUTE-ON-YOU-,-**THEY-ARE-NOT-FOR-YOU!**               |3:00              |

|There is this emphasis on like getting married to the right person and hopefully being financially stable enough to do that and then starting a family. These are things that I know I desire, I grew up with them. And sometimes that can seem like it's even further away than it already feels and then **there are like all these white women** who want to **make you feel like shit** because it's the system you want to participate in.                |31:10        |
|If you put a bunch of NBA players in line and they faced all of their partners in line. You would see very clear distinctions between a line of black men and then their female partners. If you saw any black faces in the line of partners they're gonna be, you know... "light brights" or possibly ethnically ambiguous and you know the wavy hair and the whole... **"All my broads is foreign" I hate that shit so much**.                 |40:30        |

|I would say your **average american white person is medium racist**               |36:45        |
|If they were white... If Nia Long was white. She'd probably be like... I don't even want to sit here and name names because people be salty 'cause I name out all these **untalented white people** that be at the Oscars every year. I'm serious there are some white epople at the oscars every year, and I'm like why? ... **All them white girls** that be at the Oscars don't act like Cate Blanchett. Like y'all aint all Maryl Streep.              |47:00        |
|One of these **ugly little white boys** I went to Highschool with told me I was funny looking. I would pay money to see what he looks like right fuckin' now. Rob. I'm not gonna say your last name, but **I will fuckin' name you**.  |51:50        |

| We had **too many white kids** and people were concerned that they wouldn't be exposed to any black people... | 29:30 |
| **White people** - if there is anything y'all are good at its doing too Fuckin' much. See for example Iggy Izalia, Miley Cyrus, justin Bieber, Eminem. Like what happened to the word Bae, Fleek, fuckin' fleek!  | 30:06      |
|It was really **lonely** growing up and really **isolating** and **really creepy** and so **weird** growing up around very few people who **looked like me** | 33:06      |
|I was in Honors and AP classes and **they weren't gonna let any black kids in those class** | 33:06      |
|There was one black woman teacher and she taught the other section of minority voices, but yeah. They would have classes like that, but they were taught by **white people who didn't know anything** | 35:25      |
| (Talking about diversity conference) it was **the best** because... you could **complain** about how much you didn't like it and **how racist everyone was** | 36:36      |
|**Getting kids to figure out** that the most powerful thing you can be in society is a **straight white man** and the least powerful thing you can be is a **single black mother**, like we didn't do exercises like that in High School. | 37:26      |
|How **fucking entitled** is it that your children need to know about white activists so that they can then **feel empowered to not be dicks** | 44:00     |
| I have literally been called some type of slur probably every single year of my life since 1993 that is 22 years. **You feeling bad because you're white an your parents can afford shit does not mean a goaddamn mother fucking thing to me** (Eric goes on to explain how the word "boy" is a slur ) | 46:56|
| (discussing a "diversity scared straight" fantasy) I want to get these **little twits** between 18 and 22... ...please let me engage with **white frat boys**. I will go in there with jeans and a t-shirt I will let them know I'm coming in peace and then **I would tear their asses up**.| 1:10:42      |

##Dear White People

| **White supremacy** is so fucked up that, like Eric said, like people don't care about black folks and brown folks living in the projects but, ...**shit changes when white people with young children move in**. Look at fucking Park Slope! Park Slope looks like Baby 'R Us and the whole thing used to be like... Park slope was something else maybe 30 years ago. But like white people with children are the only things that can ever shift the needle like white families are.. like that's how fucked up white sup... ...which also like even speaks more **white families** even speaks more like changing quality of life and country and there's so much in that there's like patriarchy in that... theres hetero-patriarchy in that... theres like fuckin' normative family, you know, nuclear... this kinda shit, there's all that kinda shit in there... Yeah! **That's how fucked up our... the United States is**. It doesn't even... and probably I'd have to guess the rest of the world. It's like white... the white family, the nuclear white family, the upwardly mobile nuclear white family is like the only thing that is valued if you look at our policies.                     |35:20           |
|Eric: There's times when it can be **fun to, like rib white people** every black person like enjoys that. Brittany: Yeah |51:13|

##Blacks In Tech

| Quote        | Time           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| (Talking about black people hiring other black people) Eric: ...they wonder immediately: "is that because they come from a background that is different than everyone else?" And then you're responsible for that and they're like: "Well, did you hire them because they're black like you?" Brittany: You can't ask somebody else: "oh hey, you know such and such developer is fucking up, is it because you guys are white? Did you hire her because she's white like you?" <Laughing> "**I think her pre-occupation with Taylor Swift keeps her from being able to code as well as the rest of the team.**" ... **And that's the logic that keeps a lot of people who look like us out... legitimately**.              |25:00              |
|White people are going to be a minority in 2040? Which... I kinda think that's a logical fallacy...               |26:50              |

| ------------- |:-------------:|
|The people they have you thinking are the violent ones those are the people who are being acted upon long before there was a brick going through a window. It was policy, it was things that were based on people's opinions or based on keeping certain structures in place that were then codified into law. All of those things that our government or our policy structures have in place to keep black folks where they are especially those things that serve to keep us from services that we need, living someplace with a decent tax base that you can **actually be able to partake in the things you're supposed to get for being a tax paying citizen**. **Those things are violent**.                 |33:00        |
| **In general I don't condone violence**, but you must also see **red-lining as violence** and you have to see the **ghetto as public policy as violence**              |44:45        |
|**White supremacy affects every single system we have in this country**... ...Do you benefit from **white supremacy**? **Hell. Mother. Fucking. Yes**. The same way I have two able legs and I benefit from them working.                |52:30        |
| **White supremacy is so insidius** that to be a black woman is to be the polar opposite of a **white man**. So just bare with us. We live in this **white supremacist hetero-patriarchy** which is like a fancy way of saying if you are not a **straight white man** then **you are fucked** in some type of way. So, we live in this **white supremecist hetero-patriarchy** and at the **top of that pyramid is a white man**. So like, other countries are set up different ways, I'm not gonna speak on that, but in America **the polar oppostite of that is being a black woman**. **White supremacy**, the way it's set up, **black women don't exist**.               |57:02        |
|There is more than one recording of Nina Simone singing "Missisipi Godamn"... **she has such pep and such energy** and if you've never heard the song **you must be white**. (laughing)               |1:03:24        |

| ------------- |:-------------:|
|The conversations that white people have when black people aren't in the room are like Donald Trump's platform  |0:29|
|It's just so mind-blowing to me how Primarily White Institutions (PWIs) are so **ill equipped to support black thought at any fucking level**.                |44:30              |
|It really **goes to say something about white folks** to say that despite everything that we've discussed in the past hour I was still like you know, I don't think I need to attend one of the top tier schools in the country possibly the best public institution that our nation has to offer. I was like I'm gonna skip Michigan I'm good.          |48:00              |
|When we sing it after "I'm so glad I go to Howard U" we say **"And not a white school!" at every single event. It's beautiful. It's beautiful.**          |49:50          |

|If you go see someone who is **possibly white**... or not black let's say, there is **a really good chance you could get misdiagnosed.**               |42:40        |
|There are many black women who have depression, but they're **not necessarily getting diagnosed** as depressed because a **white provider** doesn't understand them and is viewing them through such a thick fog of stereotypes that they don't know how to find... they read it instead as anxious.               |46:40        |

##And All That Jazz feat. Jazmine Hughes

| ------------- |:-------------:|
|**White people are co-opting racial humor** and co-opting **"white people be white" jokes**, which is one of **my great joys**.|12:25|
|Jazmine Hughes: I wasn't saying white people should stop making the jokes. **I think white people should stop doing a lot of stuff** and making jokes is further down the list. But I was saying if you're going to make these jokes you're not helping anything. You're not helping the cause by making fun of white people because **you are still white**, and **you still benefit from the white supremacy that guides our society** and you're not making anybody feel good. Brittany: Yeah, it just kinda serves to make you **feel a little less bad about being white**.               |19:48        |
| ..especially if we're going to be **yelling at white people** every week               | 23:00       |

| ------------- |:-------------:|
| **Soraya Nadia McDonald**: I think it's so great when we see in the movie that she has this reverse paper bag test and she **tells this girl to get off the stage cause she's too light**. She says **"No High Yellow Bitches"** and she threw the paper bag an I was just like **this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life**.              |6:10        |
|... Black cool is able to sell that. I'm not comin' for **all white girls** right now, but Taylor Swift definitely **reeks of "White Girl Desperation"**.               |20:45        |
|Janet was an existing superstar, but being a black woman and having sexual agency and then having people see her nipple which like... Jesus... If you've been to the club at any point in the past 10 years, man, even without trying you've seen some nipples **y'all need to grow the fuck up**.                |29:40        |
|Our space always has to be managed. I think **a lot of white people** feel like **our space and our agency has to be managed by them**. Like you say, "happening on their own terms".               |31:50        |

| ------------- |:-------------:|
|(Talking about a scene in the movie Boomerang) Eric: Grace Jones pops out in a chariot drawn by **white men. With a whip.** Brittany: **Amazing! Amazing!** ...Like they just went for it in every single sense. The only **white men** that speak in the movie are French. They don't even speak english, so **they can't even express anything**. Like all of the **white people** in this movie are rendered **irrelevant and speechless**.               |24:20        |
|For me in my life **Blackness is the norm** and my interactions a lot of times like obviously outside of my true social interactions with white people that I'm friends with and know and like and care about, but like with people that I don't really know are going to be with **people that are racially profiling me** or people that are **committing some sort of micro-aggression against me**.                  |31:00        |

|I actually think **I only see black movies** in theaters.               |3:35        |
|Brittany: Eric and I live in black parts of Brooklyn specifically and Kip's Bay is like **"White Yuppie-ville."** Eric: There's like a lot of white women pushing strollers and lots of Chipotle and like yoga and like spray tans. It's like a really interesting place. Brittany: It's **not interesting** actually, is the best way to put it. I think Kip's Bay is **corny**. Upper East Side **at least they have money**.                |4:20        |
|Even with experiencing that, I'm never going to be that person that's like "Uhhh, people don't understand me because I'm just not like everybody else and cause I'm from the suburbs and because I listen to music and because **I like white shit**". **I hate that shit**."               |19:58        |
|There are plenty of words I'm not allowed to use. There are F words and C words and D words and other C words and T words that other people can use among themselves that I.. not only can I not use them... I have no fucking desire... I have no desire that is painful to someone else even as a term of endearment. If you use that. That's y'all's word and you all enjoy using it. Live it the fuck up, use it at the club, put it in your music, say it to your family... And don't act like **"Cracker"** is the same thing.               |51:10        |
